- record any keystrokes from the keyboard as well as any mouse inputs
- translate keystrokes from machine code to human readable characters
- is not dependent on the language of a specific computer
- should be dissimulated in the process tree of the task manager as an Microsoft Software
- should bypass any antivirus
- encrypts the information grabbed from the target computer and stores it securely
- decrypts the information at the receiver
- has a timer, and at a specific threshold it sends the information obtained in an email to the receiver
